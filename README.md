This Web App is for all those people who can barely decide what they want for lunch, let alone what game to play! Our app makes it a little easier to decide by categorizing games by different filters and compiles a list based of your search criteria.

It uses an user created list of video games (API) that helps users decide what video game to play. Once they’ve entered their video games in the search bar, they can see suggestions based on different filters. 

The User will be able to sort their games into categories like number of players, category, console, and rating. They will also be able to look at an unfiltered list of all the games they own on the Profile page. 

When they open the page, they’ll see a search area where they can choose what filters they want to search by. Once they enter their filters, another page will show up with the suggested games. The 3rd page will be a “profile” to see a list of all the games they’ve added along with a form to search through more games. We want to be able to search by at least 3 filters, but additional filters could be added if time allows. Another option is to add a button that suggests a random game for you to play.
